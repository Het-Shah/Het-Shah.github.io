Hello! કેમ છો? I am Het Shah, a Computer Science Undergraduate from Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, K. K. Birla Goa Campus. I am currently working as a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/" target="_blank">PROSE</a> team at Microsoft Research. Prior to joining as a RF I spent a year as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research India where I was advised by Dr. Navin Goyal. Previously, I completed my undergraduate thesis at <a href="http://visual-computing.in/home/" target="_blank">Visual Computing Lab(VCL)</a> at IISc Bangalore, where I was advised by <a href="http://visual-computing.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/anirban-chakraborty.html" target="_blank">Prof. Anirban Chakraborty</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-nayak-6227ba53" target="_blank">Gaurav Kumar Nayak</a> on <b>"Incremental Learning for Animal Pose Estimation"</b>.  

I was an Undergraduate Student Researcher at <a href="https://bits-pilani.ac.in/APPCAiR/" target="_blank" >Anuradha and Prashanth Palakurthi Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (APPCAIR)</a> Lab at my University where I worked on "Iterative Knowledge Distillation" and "Reasoning abilities of Transformer networks". I have also taught various courses related to Python and Deep Learning (you can find the list <a href="https://het-shah.github.io/teaching/" target="_black">here</a>). 

My current research interests are 
<ul>
  <li>how humans brain can motivate neural network models specifically how humans reason and how can we create models to solve reasoning tasks with Neural Networks;</li>
  <li>how to effectively represent various data forms especially visual input;</li>
  <li>are neural models the best way to represent the input data or do we need some symbolism along with the neural models for effective representation;</li>
</ul>
