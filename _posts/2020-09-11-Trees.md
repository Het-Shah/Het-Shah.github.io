### Important points : 
- Searching in a tree 
- Left, Right, Top, Bottom view of a binary tree 
- Depth/Height of a tree (Many questions are based on this (I got two questions in two different company's interviews based on this)). 
- Preorder, Postorder, Inorder Traversal (You'll end up using one for pretty much every tree question(I used preorder))
