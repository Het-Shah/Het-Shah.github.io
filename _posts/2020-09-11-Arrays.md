### Important Concepts : 

- Sorting (Merge sort and quick sort algorithms should be on your tips)
- upper_bound and lower_bound functions 
- Sliding window/two pointers a lot of questions are based on this.
- Intervals related problems (asked frequently)
- Know calculation of time complexity and space complexity.
- Hashing (you might not need a map everytime (for C++) you can use an array too)
