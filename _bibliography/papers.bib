      author={Het Shah and Avishree Khare and Neelay Shah and Khizir Siddiqui},
      abstract={In recent years, the growing size of neural networks has led to a vast amount of research concerning compression techniques to mitigate the drawbacks of such large sizes. Most of these research works can be categorized into three broad families : Knowledge Distillation, Pruning, and Quantization. While there has been steady research in this domain, adoption and commercial usage of the proposed techniques has not quite progressed at the rate. We present KD-Lib, an open-source PyTorch based library, which contains state-of-the-art modular implementations of algorithms from the three families on top of multiple abstraction layers. KD-Lib is model and algorithm-agnostic, with extended support for hyperparameter tuning using Optuna and Tensorboard for logging and monitoring. The library can be found at - https://github.com/SforAiDl/KD_Lib},

  title={An Autoencoder Based Approach to Simulate Sports Games},
  author={Ashwin Vaswani and Rijul Ganguly and Het Shah and Sharan Ranjit S and Shrey Pandit and Samruddhi Bothara},
  abstract = {Sports data has become widely available in the recent past. With the improvement of machine learning techniques, there have been attempts to use sports data to analyze not only the outcome of individual games but also to improve insights and strategies. The outbreak of COVID-19 has interrupted sports leagues globally, giving rise to increasing questions and speculations about the outcome of this season's leagues. What if the season was not interrupted and concluded normally? Which teams would end up winning trophies? Which players would perform the best? Which team would end their season on a high and which teams would fail to keep up with the pressure? We aim to tackle this problem and develop a solution. In this paper, we proposeUCLData, which is a dataset containing detailed information of UEFA Champions League games played over the past six years. We also propose a novel autoencoder based machine learning pipeline that can come up with a story on how the rest of the season will pan out.},
