  abstract = {Sports data has become widely available in the recent past. With the improvement of machine learning techniques, there have been attempts to use sports data to analyze not only the outcome of individual games but also to improve insights and strategies. The outbreak of COVID-19 has interrupted sports leagues globally, giving rise to increasing questions and speculations about the outcome of this season's leagues. What if the season was not interrupted and concluded normally? Which teams would end up winning trophies? Which players would perform the best? Which team would end their season on a high and which teams would fail to keep up with the pressure? We aim to tackle this problem and develop a solution. In this paper, we proposeUCLData, which is a dataset containing detailed information of UEFA Champions League games played over the past six years. We also propose a novel autoencoder based machine learning pipeline that can come up with a story on how the rest of the season will pan out.},
